I'm a software engineer interested in math-heavy problems including but not limited to cryptography, probabilistic models, quantum computing, and algorithm design. I'm also intrigued by sound engineering, digital compression, astrophysics, philosophy, and film.

I'll be using this blog to write about those topics and more. In most cases, I write about a topic in order to help myself learn it. As such, my posts may contain inaccuracies and shouldn't be taken as a source of truth!
