I'm a software engineer interested in treating computer science as a field of applied math. I am drawn to the math-y side of theoretical CS as well as math-heavy applications such as cryptography, probabilistic modeling, quantum computing, digital compression, and algorithm design. I'm also intrigued by sound engineering, astrophysics, philosophy, and film.

I'll be using this blog to write about all of those topics and more. In most cases I write about a topic in order to help myself learn it. As such, my posts may contain inaccuracies and shouldn't be taken as a source of truth!
