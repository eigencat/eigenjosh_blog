As I'm sure you all know, it's illegal to start a dev blog without titling the first post "Hello World." So here I am to pay my dues.

This is the first of (hopefully) many posts where I'll explore a variety of topics, mostly in the intersection of math and computer science. I've found that writing about a topic is a powerful way to improve my understanding of it, and I intend to use this blog to take full advantage of that fact.
